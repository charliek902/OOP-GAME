# OOP GAME

I decided to keep up my OOP skills by creating a game using pygame.
Technologies used: Python (OOP) 

Enemies use a depth first search algorithm to navigate around walls and locate the player. At a certain distance the player will proceed to fire. 

Enemies can also dodge bullets and within this game an enemy factory class generates waves of enemies which progressively get harder for thew user to beat
